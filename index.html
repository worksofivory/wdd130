    <p>I am an aspiring computer programmer and moderately experienced artist. 
        I love videogames and tabletop RPGs, and enjoy a good animated movie.</p>
    <p> I'm from all over the country, spending most of my growing up moving around every few years. 
        The most unique place I've stayed had to have been Alaska.</p>
